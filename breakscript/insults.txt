You been sittin' here for 2 bloody hours?! Get off yer arse or I’ll rice your face!
Yer workstation's cryin’, ya crusty code gremlin! BREAK OR BE BROKEN!
This ain't Dark Souls. You can't keep dodging sleep, mate!
You've got the posture of a shrimp. Uncurl yourself and take a lap!
You look like a terminal error given flesh. Take a walk!
I'm not mad. I'm just disappointed... in your eyeballs.
If you don’t rest now, I’m piping `/dev/random` straight into your config.
Is this a work session or a torture chamber? GET UP, RICE SLAVE.
